ANN is a program which simulates an artificial neural network. 

TANN is a program which tests an artificial neural network. 

AGE is a program which generates training data for an AND gate. 

MNISTF generates training data for image recognition of the numbers 1 - 9.

AGE and MNISTF can be found in the Examples directory, under AND Gate and Image 
Recognition, respectively.

To compile the source code: 

	- To make an ANN executable: Type “make ANN” in the terminal.

	- To make a TANN executable: Type “make TANN” in the terminal.

        - To make an AGE executable: Type “make AGE” in the terminal.

        - To make an MNISTF executable: Type “make MNISTF” in the terminal.

	- To clean up the files afterwards: Type “make clean” in the 
                                            terminal.

	- To run ANN: Type “./ANN” after making an executable, then follow
                      the on-screen instructions (surround file names like
                      so when instructed: “‘...’”.

	- To run TANN: Type “./TANN” after making an executable, then follow
                       the on-screen instructions (surround file names like
                       so when instructed: “‘...’”.

        - To run AGE: Type “./AGE” after making an executable, then follow
                      the on-screen instructions (surround file names like
                      so when instructed: “‘...’”.

        - To run MNISTF: Type “./MNISTF” after making an executable, then follow
                         the on-screen instructions (surround file names like so 
                         when instructed: “‘...’”.

The training data format can be found in the file ‘Training_Data_Format.txt’.
